    "methodology": "Boston Housing Data: \r\n-Loaded data from the MASS library.\r\n-Split into 90% training and 10% testing.\r\n-Built and visualized a regression tree model predicting the target median home value (medv).\r\n-Visualized the regression tree using the prp function.\r\n-Calculated in-sample MSE (Mean Squared Error) at 17.2 and out-of-sample MSE at 27.4, indicating possible overfitting.\r\n-Created a linear regression model, excluding \u2018indus\u2019 and \u2018age\u2019 variables.\r\n-The linear regression model had in-sample MSE of 21.5 and out-of-sample MSE of 25.5, showing that CART might fit non-linear relationships better.\r\nGerman Credit Data: \r\n-Loaded and preprocessed German Credit data, converting categorical variables into factors.\r\n-Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.\r\n-Built a classification tree predicting credit defaults.\r\n-Developed a second model applying a weighted cost matrix (false negatives cost 5x more than false positives).\r\n-Compared the models and evaluated misclassification costs.\r\n-Tested out-of-sample performance, showing possible improvements in handling misclassifications.",
