    "description": "<p>This project analyzes obesity trends and contributing factors using machine learning models. It employs <strong>Linear Regression, Regression Trees, and Random Forests</strong> to predict weight based on demographic and lifestyle factors. The dataset is sourced from the <strong>UCI Machine Learning Repository</strong>.</p>",
    "methodology": "<ul>\
<li><strong>Data Preprocessing & EDA:</strong>\
<ul>\
<li>Analyzed key variables such as Age, Height, and Weight using histograms and scatter plots.</li>\
<li>Identified patterns in the dataset, including right-skewed distributions and correlation clusters.</li>\
</ul></li>\
<li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong>\
<ul>\
<li>Built a stepwise regression model to predict Weight.</li>\
<li>Removed non-significant predictors (SMOKE, SCC).</li>\
<li>Achieved an <strong>RÂ² value of 96.29%</strong>, indicating strong predictability.</li>\
</ul></li>\
<li><strong>Regression Tree:</strong>\
<ul>\
<li>Developed a decision tree to classify obesity levels.</li>\
<li>Height and obesity category (NObeyesdad) were the strongest predictors.</li>\
<li>Performed pruning to reduce overfitting.</li>\
</ul></li>\
<li><strong>Random Forest Model:</strong>\
<ul>\
<li>Built an ensemble model with <strong>100 decision trees</strong>.</li>\
<li>Feature importance analysis showed <strong>NObeyesdad, Height, and Family History</strong> as top contributors.</li>\
<li>The model had high accuracy but risked overfitting, requiring hyperparameter tuning.</li>\
</ul></li>\

      "story": "<p>Obesity is a growing epidemic influenced by multiple demographic and lifestyle factors. Using data-driven methods, this study explores how different features contribute to an individual's weight and obesity classification.

<li><strong>Dataset:</strong> <strong>UCI Machine Learning Repository - Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition</strong></li>\
<li><strong>17 Variables:</strong> Includes Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Family History, Physical Activity, and Eating Habits.</li>\
<li><strong>Key Insights:</strong>\
<ul>\
<li>The average weight in the dataset is <strong>83kg</strong>, ranging from <strong>39kg to 173kg</strong>.</li>\
<li><strong>Height and obesity category (NObeyesdad) are the strongest predictors</strong> of weight.</li>\
</ul></li>\
</ul>",
      "conclusions": "<ul>\
<li><strong>Linear Regression performed best</strong>, achieving an <strong>out-of-sample error of 23.85</strong>.</li>\
<li><strong>Regression Tree showed structured decision-making</strong>, but pruning was necessary to avoid overfitting.</li>\
<li><strong>Random Forest was highly accurate</strong>, but risked overfitting.</li>\
<li><strong>Future Work:</strong> Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation could further improve prediction accuracy.</li>\
